# demos from the GDG meetup

### To run the demos
To run the demos, you need to create a firebase project
in your own console and copy and paste the config on the 
project setup tab into the index.html files were it 
says: 'your config here'.

There are additional steps to take to run the flutter demo. 
You have to add an ios/android app to your project and 
use the installation steps from firebase to add the config
and json files into the native projects.

If you have any questions about the demo's or setting them up, 
feel free to contact me.
